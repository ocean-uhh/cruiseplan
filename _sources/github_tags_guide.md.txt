## 🎯 How to Add Tags to Your Repository

1. **On GitHub.com:**
   - Go to your repository
   - Click the ⚙️ gear icon next to "About"
   - Add topics in the "Topics" field
   - Click "Save changes"

2. **Best Practices:**
   - Use 3-10 relevant tags
   - Include the primary `oceanography` tag
   - Add specific tags for your data type or method
   - Consider both technical (`python`, `netcdf`) and scientific (`physical-oceanography`) tags
   - Use consistent spelling (check existing tag usage)

3. **Example tag combination for a Python SST analysis project:**
   ```
   oceanography, sea-surface-temperature, python, xarray, 
   data-analysis, remote-sensing, climate-science
   ```

# SECTIONS [optional]
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Define here the list of transects that will be covered during the research cruise. 
# Each section has a start and end point, described by a geo-coordinate. If sections 
# are not a straight line, e.g. two parts forming a vertex, this can be specified 
# here by two sections having the same end and start point at one location.
# 
# Each section MUST contain following attributes: 
# 
#    name: 
#        A freely chosen label to name and distinguish sections.
#   
#    start: 
#       Start position of the section described by longitude and latitude. 
#       Example: 65.745908, -24.479081
#   
#    end: 
#       End position of the section described by longitude and latitude. 
#       Example: 67.894528, -30.209139
#  
# Each section CAN contain following attributes:
#
#    distance_between_stations: 
#       The distance in kilometers between stations that are evenly 
#       distributed along the section's route. If this attribute is not
#       set for a section, the global attribute default_distance_between_sections
#       will be used.
#   
#    moorings:
#       A list of moorings deployed or recovered along the section. 
#       Each mooring can be described by these attributes:
#       
#       name:      Unique name of the mooring.
#       position:  Geo coordinate of the mooring's location.
#       duration:  Time needed for mooring in minutes.
#       action:    "deployment" or "recovery".
#       comment:   Optional comment.

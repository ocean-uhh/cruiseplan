# CRUISE PLANNING WORKFLOW - Next Steps:
# ======================================================================================
# 1. Review and update all 'UPDATE-*' placeholders below
# 2. Set operation_type (CTD, mooring, water_sampling, etc.)
# 3. Set action (profile, deployment, recovery, etc.)  
# 4. Run validation: cruiseplan validate <filename>
# 5. Add depths: cruiseplan enrich <filename> --add-depths --add-coords --expand-sections   
# 6. Generate schedule: cruiseplan schedule <filename>
